### About Me

I'm a fourth year student at the University of Toronto doing a double major in *economics* and *history*. I have an incredible interest in history, ranging from various periods and regions. However, I am most interested in [Asian History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Asia), such as Chinese and Japanese history.

I look forward to updating this further.
